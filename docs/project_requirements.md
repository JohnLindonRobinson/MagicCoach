# Project Requirements
## Functional Requirements
### 1. Input Parsing:

The tool must accept JSON-formatted game state data and decklists for both players.
Game state data should include:
- Playersâ€™ hands
- Cards on the battlefield
- Graveyards
- Mana available
- Player life totals and other relevant stats (e.g., poison counters, loyalty on planeswalkers).
- Decklist data must include:
- Main deck and sideboard cards.

### 2. Game State Validation:

The tool must validate the legality of the game state and decklists (e.g., legal number of cards, valid card names).

It should reject or flag invalid input (e.g., malformed JSON, invalid card names).

### 3. Move Suggestion:

The tool should provide move suggestions based on the current game state, considering cards in hand, cards on the battlefield, and available mana.
Suggestions should include:
- Playable cards from the hand.
- Use of abilities on the battlefield (e.g., creature abilities, planeswalkers).
- Potential strategies (e.g., attacking, defending, preserving resources).

### 4. Move Evaluation:

The tool must provide a ranked list of move suggestions based on their estimated impact on the game outcome.
Heuristics should be used to evaluate:
- Board control
- Life total and defense
- Card advantage (number of cards drawn or discarded)
- Mana efficiency.

### 5. AI-Powered Optimization (Future Requirement):

Implement a machine learning model to improve move suggestions over time by analyzing past game data.
Use reinforcement learning or similar AI techniques to continuously refine move recommendations.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### 1. Performance:

The tool should provide move suggestions within a reasonable timeframe (< 5 seconds) for a typical game state.
### 2. Scalability:

The architecture should allow for future expansion, such as multiplayer support or additional game formats (e.g., Commander).
### 3. Usability:

The tool should be easy to use via a command-line interface (CLI) initially, with potential for a web-based UI later.
### 4. Portability:

The tool should be platform-independent, able to run on any machine with Python 3.x installed.
