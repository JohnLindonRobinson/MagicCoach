# Core Features Breakdown
## 1. Input Parsing and Validation
- Game State Input: JSON-based format to describe the current game state, including all key game elements.
- Decklist Input: JSON-based format for representing playersâ€™ decks, which will be used to check available cards in the game.
- Validation: Ensure the provided game state and decklists follow valid MTG rules (e.g., correct card names, legal moves).
## 2. Game State Analysis Engine
- Rules Engine: Implement logic to ensure that move suggestions follow MTG rules, such as phase restrictions and mana costs.
- Move Suggestions: Based on the game state, the tool should suggest potential plays (e.g., playing creatures, casting spells, using abilities).
- Move Evaluation: Provide rankings for suggested moves using a basic heuristic that accounts for game objectives like board control, life total, and card advantage.
## 3. AI-Powered Move Optimization (Future)
- AI Integration: Add an AI component that learns optimal moves through game data analysis.
- Reinforcement Learning: The AI improves its decision-making by analyzing previous game outcomes and suggesting better moves in future games.
## 4. Output and Visualization
- Move Recommendations: Return the move suggestions in ranked order.
- Move Details: For each suggestion, provide a breakdown of its potential benefits and drawbacks (e.g., how it affects life totals, board presence, or card advantage).
- Visualization (Optional): In future versions, provide visual output of the game state and potential moves through a UI or web interface.
## 5. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Input: Allow users to input game state and decklist files via the command line.
- Output: Display the ranked list of move suggestions in a user-friendly format, potentially outputting additional data to JSON or log files for further analysis.
