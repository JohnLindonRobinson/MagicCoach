# Simple Project Roadmap
## Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Week 1)
- [x] Set up the project repository and configure the environment.
- [x] Define the JSON schema for game states and decklists.
- [x] Document requirements and break down features (this step).
## Phase 2: Input Parsing & Data Handling (Weeks 2-3)
- [ ] Develop modules to parse and validate game state and decklist JSON inputs.
- [ ] Ensure the game state input captures key game elements (cards in hand, battlefield, mana, etc.).
- [ ] Write unit tests for input validation.
## Phase 3: Game State Analysis Engine (Weeks 4-6)
- [ ] Build the core rules engine to ensure legality of moves.
- [ ] Implement the logic for move suggestion based on the current game state.
- [ ] Develop heuristics for evaluating potential moves (considering board control, life total, card advantage).
## Phase 4: User Interface or API (Optional) (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Develop a simple frontend (web-based UI) or API to allow users to input JSON files and get analysis.
- [ ] Visualize the game state, move suggestions, and rankings in a clean, user-friendly format.
## Phase 5: AI-Powered Analysis and Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Integrate machine learning for more intelligent move suggestions.
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning or similar algorithms to optimize move recommendations based on game data.
- [ ] Run simulations to test and refine the AI's decision-making process.
## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 13-14)
- [ ] Perform extensive unit testing to ensure full coverage of all key components (parsing, rules engine, move suggestions).
- [ ] Deploy the project on a cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, etc.) for public access or API usage.
- [ ] Complete project documentation for future contributors and users.
## Phase 7: Future Enhancements (Ongoing)
- [ ] Add multiplayer game analysis support.
- [ ] Implement a more advanced AI system for recommending decklist improvements.
- [ ] Expand to support additional MTG formats (e.g., Commander).
